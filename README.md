# Masters-Project

Collection of the public portion of my analysis for my Master's thesis in neuroscience testing whether procedural learning can be improved with electrical and tone stimulation in rats. Includes scripts to create the videos and control the Arduino's during the experiment. 

If a paper is published on this work, it will be linked here. Until then, questions about implementation can be made in the discussions section.
