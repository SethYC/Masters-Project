%fings timestamp of stim events in a given stimulation channel and returns
%it.

%Input: eeg - tsd object for a stimulation pulse channel. This is not to be
%confused with the cortex channel that RECEIVES stimulation, this is the
%channel that records when stimulation is delivered, showing the same biphasic
%pulse that is delivered to the rat's motor cortex.
%
%output: timestamps of stim peaks (in NSMA units)
